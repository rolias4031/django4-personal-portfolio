# django4-personal-portfolio
My personal portfolio site built using Django 4

Hello, welcome to my personal site repository. This site showcases the web apps I've made with Django 4. The apps are pretty simple, but that's the point. I want each to showcase a specific skill. I've found that small projects are a great way to focus on specific concepts without overloading yourself.

I will be continually uploading new projects to this site as I complete them. I welcome any suggestions you have for project ideas.

Here's the URL: https://sailormetz.pythonanywhere.com/

So far I have three projects displayed:

The first is a dictionary app that uses PyDictionary to display the definitions, synonyms, and anytonyms for any english word.

The second is a customizable password generator that you can use to generate secure passwords.

The third is a basic calculator that can add, subtract, multiply, and divide any two numbers, and convert any number to a percentage.
