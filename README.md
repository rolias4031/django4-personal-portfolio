# django4-personal-portfolio
My personal portfolio site built using Django 4

### Overview
Welcome to my personal site repository. This site showcases the web apps I've made with Django 4. The apps are pretty simple, but that's the point. I want each to showcase a specific skill or knowledge a specific library/module.

I will be continually uploading new projects to this site as I complete them. I would welcome any suggestions you have for project ideas.

Here's the URL: https://sailormetz.pythonanywhere.com/

**So far I have three projects displayed:**

1. A dictionary app that uses PyDictionary to display the definitions, synonyms, and anytonyms for any english word.

2. A customizable password generator that you can use to generate secure passwords.

3. A basic calculator that can add, subtract, multiply, and divide any two numbers, and convert any number to a percentage.
